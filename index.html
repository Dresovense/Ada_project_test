to more clearly emphasise "language quality". Maybe reduce the time implications
and emphasise more "compared to other subreddits?")

<div class="section" style="border-top: 0px;">
    TLDR; [Maybe add a tldr, could emphasise that we are answering from a "user" per
    perspective. I'm not 100% convinced]
    <br><br>

    It's not the first time I've seen such sentiments around here. Actually,
    I find it super interesting, as such discussions about "linguistic quality" are not recent,
    in fact you can find them pretty much at any point 
    since we've begun to standardise our languages. Still, with the rise of 
    social media and instant messaging, such perceptions have been on the rise
    and it could be interesting to know if they are based on actual data. And
    if so, what motivates the difference of language quality between users.

    <br><br>

    [Should we add here the different research questions? Or do we keep
    the "comment based approach"? Or both?]

<div class="section">
    <h1>What is language quality?</h1>
    The first thing we need to know when trying to understand language quality
    on reddit, is to actually define what language quality <em>is</em>. We could 
    define language quality of a text as "<b>the similarity between a text and
    a shared construction of the "perfect" language</b>. [do you agree? should i remove it?]
    However, we cannot apply directly such a definition to our data, we need to 
    find a way to operationalise such a concept. Thus, I decided to take an
    approach that combined both what our data provided and what different measures
    suggested that this "shared construction" is, arriving at the following metric:

    <div class="important_info">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Lexical Richness</b>: Ratio of unique words in a post</li>
            <li><b>Syntactic Complexity</b>: Average words per sentence</li>
            <li><b>Readability</b>: Automated Readability Index</li>
            <li><b>Cognitive Depth</b>: LIWC reasoning and complexity measures</li>
        </ul>
        [add justifications]

            style="border:none;">

    [add only the features that we end up choosing, maybe more if interactive]
    <br>
    [Also, develop on the insights of these features]

    <img src="assets/plots/feature_correlation_matrix.png" width="70%">
    [we should refocus the plot on our current variables, and maybe
    add a interactive feature where we can explore other potential variables]

    <br><br>
    As you can see in this correlation matrix, our chosen features do not
    seem to overlap, showing that they each embody one aspect of Linguistic
    cognition and thus capture meaningful language patterns.

    <br><br>
    [We need to add more info, but depends on what features we end up choosing
    in the end]
